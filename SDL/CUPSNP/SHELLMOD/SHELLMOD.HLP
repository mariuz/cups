 NUCLEAR SHELL MODEL: SPHERICAL & DEFORMED NUCLEI 01
    This simulation explores the single particle  02
    model for the spherical and deformed shell    03
    models. You have four main menu choices:      04
1. Shell Model-Potential:  This explores nuclear  05
    wavefunctions and energy levels for three     06
    different potentials.                         07
2. Shell Model-Nuclei:  The experimental          08
    value for the spin and parity of the nucleus  09
    is compared with the shell model prediction.  10
3. Deformed Potential:  The anisotropic harmonic  11
    oscillator is used to represent the deformed  12
    nucleus. Energy levels as a function of       13
    deformation are explored.                     14
4. Deformed Nuclei: The deformed shell model      15
    predictions of nuclear spin and parity for six16
    nuclei are compared with experimental values. 17

             SHELL MODEL POTENTIALS               01
The Schrodinger equation is solved with your      02
choice of a spherically symmetric potential.  You 03
can choose the depth of the potential,            04
diffuseness of the Woods-Saxon potential, number  05
of neutrons and protons in the nucleus (the sum   06
must be odd), and the strength of the spin-orbit  07
interaction.                                      08
The left display shows the shape of the potential 09
normalized to -1, the shape of the wavefunction,  10
and the energy levels for the chosen nucleus and  11
potential. The potential is drawn with & without  12
spin-orbit coupling except for the square well    13
where energy levels are only calculated without   14
spin-orbit coupling. The right display shows all  15
the energy levels found, the degeneracy of each   16
level, the sum of the degeneracies, and the magic 17
numbers.                                          18

              SHELL MODEL NUCLEI                  01
A comparison is made between the experimental     02
value and the shell model prediction of the spin  03
and parity for an odd-A nucleus. The      04
experimental value is obtained from a look up     05
table and the shell model prediction is obtained  06
from the spin and parity of the unpaired nucleon. 07
The isotopes listed in the look up table is       08
limited to nominally spherical nuclei.            09
The upper left display shows information about the10
nucleus and which state is being considered. The  11
lower left display shows information about the     12
stability or abundance of the nucleus and the spin13
and parity. The right display shows the levels    14
around the unpaired nucleon and the occupation of 15
the levels. Neutron levels (in blue) and Proton   16
levels (in red) are shown separately.             17

           DEFORMED SHELL MODEL LEVELS            01
The Nilsson anisotropic harmonic oscillator (HO)  02
potential is used to explore the energy levels of 03
deformed odd-A nuclei of various sizes. The left  04
display shows energy levels as a function of      05
deformation, Î.  They are labeled on the far left 06
with a spherical state label; n, l, j & on the    07

levels are drawn in blue and even parity levels   14
are drawn in red. The right display shows the     15
energy levels for a particular Î, indicated on the16
left display by a solid vertical line. You can    17
change the value of Î by dragging the line to a   18
new value. The right display will change to match 19
the new value of Î that was chosen.               20

NUCLEAR POTENTIAL INPUT: THE SPHERICAL SHELL MODEL01
    1. Select the potential form which will be    02
       integrated in the Schrodinger equation.    03
                                                  04
    2. Input the absolute value of the potential  05
       at r = 0.                                  06
                                                  07
    3. The potential is more rounded when the     08
       diffuseness factor is large. This factor is09
        automatically set to zero for the Square  10
       Well and Harmonic Oscillator potentials.   11
                                                  12
    4. The number of neutrons and protons deter-  13
       mines the size of the nuclear potential.   14
       The sum is odd because this simulation     15
       considers single particle states.          16

    5. Input a number which determines the        18
       spacing between the two levels: j=l+s and  19
       j=l-s. If the number is negative j=l+s is  20
       lower than j=l-s.                          21
