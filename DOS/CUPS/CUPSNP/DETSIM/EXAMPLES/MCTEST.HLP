MCTest

 This program generates random distributions
 according to a Gaussian and a Breit-Wigner
 (or Lorentzian) distribution. The number of
 events generated may be changed in the code.
 After generating the events the distributions
 are fitted with the appropriate functions.
 The center and width of the fitting functions
 may be chosen in an input menu. The value of
 chi-squared for the fit is displayed.
