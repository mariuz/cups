  Wav_base.pas   // Atoms, buttons, and other display objects
  Wav_Plot.pas   // A generic plot objects that has scale, knows how to go full screen etc.

{Wave runs best if it and the CUPS utilites are compiled for PROTECTED memory. If the program
is compiled for REAL mode you may have trouble with some types of analysis if you machine  has less
than  600K of free memory.}

{The following compiler switches will otpimize wave.}
