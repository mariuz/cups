                    CUPS Programs
             (c) 1994, John Wiley & Sons

This disk contains CUPS DOS (PC Compatible) programs for the Classical
Mechanics course.  To install the programs, simply go to the floppy 
drive, and type install followed by the name of the drive and directory 
where you want the programs to be installed.  For example, typing 
install c:\cups will place the programs in the CUPS directory on your c: 
drive.  You could also just type install without specifying a directory 
or drive, and c:\cups is the assumed choice.

The driver program (cupscm.exe) for running all programs can be found in 
the CUPSCM subdirectory.  You may run any of the programs using this 
driver.  Alternatively, if you switch to the directory containing a 
particular program, you can run it individually by simply typing its 
name. To run the programs you should have a color monitor, mouse, and 
preferably a 386 with math coprocessor.  More information on running 
CUPS programs can be found in the introduction to all CUPS books.

Appendix A to each CUPS book is a collection of "Walk Throughs" -- quick 
guided tours for running the programs.  More information about all 
programs in the CUPS Project can be found in the introduction to the 
book.
