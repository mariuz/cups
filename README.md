C.U.P.S (Consortium for Upper-Level Physics Software) archive

The original website for C.U.P.S project is archived here:
https://web.archive.org/web/20150304034759/http://physics.gmu.edu/~cups/

The original C.U.P.S. software ran under MS-DOS.  It can still be run in a DOS emulator

This site contains:
  - The original DOS install disk images.
  - A fully expanded tree of DOS software after installation, including bug fixes.
  - Some experimental work to build with a modern PASCAL compiler and SDL.

This software can be run in an emulator such as DOSBOX.

I would like to eventually make all of this software runnable in a browser, on the Internet Archive.
